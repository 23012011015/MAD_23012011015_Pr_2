# Android Application: Activity Life Cycle & Basic UI Demonstration

## 📱 Overview

This Android application is developed as part of a practical assignment to **demonstrate the functions of the Activity Life Cycle** and implement **Basic UI components**. It is intended for beginners to understand how Android activities work and how user interfaces are created using standard UI elements.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the **Activity Life Cycle** (`onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, `onRestart()`, and `onDestroy()`).
- Implement **Basic UI Components** like:
- `TextView`
- `Button`
- `EditText`
- `Toast`
- `Log` messages

---

## 🛠 Features

- **Lifecycle Logging:** All lifecycle methods are overridden and contain `Log` messages to track the state of the activity.
- **UI Elements:** A simple UI with:
- A welcome `TextView`
- An `EditText` for user input
- A `Button` that displays the input using a `Toast`
- **User Interaction:** When the button is clicked, the app retrieves the text entered by the user and shows it in a short popup (`Toast`).
